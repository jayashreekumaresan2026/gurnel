# Gurnel
## Daily journaling for hackers

* ### BYOE (Bring your own editor)
  Use the editor you're already comfortable with. Gurnel speaks Markdown for your entries.

* ### Works with the tools of the trade
  Gurnel lives on the command line. By default, Gurnel uses Git, keeping your journal version-controlled and backed up.

* ### Blog-aware
  Works with Jekyll right out of the box, no configuration required.
